# Defender-Ignore-Keygens
Make windows defender ignore keygens and activators

Main script is [set-prefs.ps1](https://github.com/NeedsCoffee/Defender-Ignore-Keygens/blob/main/set-prefs.ps1), copy paste the code into an admin console, or run the ps1 as admin.
Collects all keygens and activator threat ids from the defender threat catalogue, combines them with current defender threat configs, and re-sets the preference.

Useful if you want to test out keygens or activation tools/scripts and windows defender keeps getting in the way.
