# Defender-Ignore-Keygens
Make windows defender ignore keygens and activators

Collects all keygens and activator threat ids from the defender threat catalogue, combines them with current defender threat configs, and re-sets the preference.

Useful if you want to test out keygens or activation tools/scripts and windows defender keeps getting in the way.
